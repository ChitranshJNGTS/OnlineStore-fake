# 🛍️ Online Fake Store

Welcome to **Online Fake Store** – a simple e-commerce frontend project built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Redux**, designed to simulate a shopping platform like Flipkart but with my own creative spin.

This project is fully functional without using any external API — everything is managed locally with a mock data structure and custom logic. It's a great demonstration of **CRUD operations**, **state management**, and **dynamic routing** in a React environment.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – Component-based UI  
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling  
- 🔁 **Redux Toolkit** – State management (cart, products, etc.)  
- 🧭 **React Router DOM** – Page navigation  
- 🛠️ **Local JSON/mock data** – No external API

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📦 **Product Listing** – View all available items  
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart** – Add, remove, and manage quantities  
- ✍️ **CRUD Operations** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete products  
- 🧭 **Routing** – Navigate between pages like Home, Cart, Add Product, etc.  
- 🧠 **Redux Store** – Handles cart items, product data, and UI state globally  
- 💾 **Persistent State (optional)** – Can be extended to localStorage

## 🎯 Future Goals (Optional)

Currently, I'm keeping it simple with local data only — no APIs. But in the future, this can be extended with:
- 🔐 Authentication  
- 💖 Wishlist  
- 📊 Filters & Sorting  
- 🌐 Backend/API Integration
